## What is Test Driven Develpoment (TDD)

A methodology that promotes following this cycle:

1. Write a "Unit Test"
2. Write code to make that unit test pass
3. When code refactoring is to occur repeat the steps all over again for each new feature

# Unit Test
Test for an individual "unit" of the application
- Functions
- Classes
The advantage of unit tests is to ensure working code

# Jest
Unit testing framework for JavaScript
Has good integration with React

A Jest file is a JS file that either ends in .test.js OR .spec.js OR resides in a __tests__ folder
