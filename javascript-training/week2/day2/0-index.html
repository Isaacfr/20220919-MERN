            Semantic tags are the same as the generic div or span, but the name carries additional semantic meaning
            You can use a div and a span for the same purpose as all of the following tags


            Block Semantic Tags:
            <article> - Represents a page article
            <nav> - Used for the navigation bar of a webpage
            <main> - Used for the main content of the entire webpage (LIMIT 1 PER PAGE)

         <div>Hello World!</div>
         <p>This is a paragraph</p>
         <!-- The spans will appear side by side since this doesn't take up the full page length -->
         <u><em>My Span tag</em></u>
